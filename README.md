# DiceyChoice
overcomplicated dice game (for use in any tabletop game, DnD etc.)

starting life as a single dice generator, since grown in concept to be a useable DnD dice set.
as is it will allow setting of players, choice of dice and then a roll of the dices chosen before the program ends. 
the next update and commit will incorporate the ability to roll the dice in turns until the application is ended
